Learning Discord.py by building a bot full of random features.

Getti's Fun-Box is a chill little experiment bot made to mess around and learn how Discord bots actually work. I'm using it as a playground to test out features like slash commands, buttons, events, and whatever else Discord.js lets me build. Itâ€™s basically a growing sandbox where I keep adding stuff as I learn new tricks.
